# Jetpack Compose + MVI
The goal of this project is to have a demo application using popular MVI Arch pattern in android, while using Jetpack Compose for UI. This project shows how less-complicated the whole codebase and testing becomes just by using Jetpack Compose.
**We will keep this project updated with latest releases of Jetpack Compose.**
- Current Jetpack Compose Version - *1.1.1*
